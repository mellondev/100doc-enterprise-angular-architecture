# 100 Days Of Code - Enterprise Angular Architectures
My 100DaysOfCode challenge is to look into different approaches to Enterprise Angular Architecture. 

## Monorepo
 I will be trying out the mono-repo idea with tools such as Nx to see how that can improve the management of an enterprise application.

## Micro-Frontends
A small re-usable set of UI Components that can be dynamically loaded into an Application Shell

3 Options for this are:

* iFrames
* Component Libraries
* Web Components

> Webpack3 has a feature to dynamically load modules remotely into your application so will be investigating that feature

## Task List

 - [x] Create Repo with Nx Workspaces
 - [ ] Create application shell project
 - [ ] Create component library to use in application shell
